1,What is Data Science?,Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves the use of statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data.
2,What are some common programming languages used in data science?,"Some common programming languages used in data science include Python, R, and SQL."
3,What is machine learning?,Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms to automatically learn patterns and make predictions from data.
4,What is supervised learning?,"Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that the data includes both input features and the correct output values."
5,What is deep learning?,"Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks, which are composed of many layers of interconnected nodes, to learn complex representations of data."
6,What is data preprocessing?,Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a format that can be used for analysis
7,What is overfitting?,"Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where the model is trained too well on the training data and becomes too specific to that data, leading to poor performance on new data."
8,What is feature selection?,"rocess of selecting a subset of the original features in a dataset that are most relevant to the task at hand, in order to improve model performance and reduce complexity."
9,What is a confusion matrix?,It a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted and actual class labels for a set of test data.
10,What is unsupervised learning?,It is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data.
